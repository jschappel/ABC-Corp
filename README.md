## Welcome to ABC Corp's Website

This project is a continuation of our [database groups final project](https://github.com/shu-csas-changgar/final-project-db-final). This version aims to redesign the website into a more friendly user experience while taking the lessons I learned from the original project to create a more thorough and powerful website.


### Project Goals:
- Add dynamic updates/create modals which allow the user to update/create any information related to their update. (Can create a new address when creating a new employee...)
- Add role based users
- Create a working reservations system
- Search feature on every view with auto-complete
- Further abstract tables using Higher Order Components
- Redesign backend server with future additions in mind
