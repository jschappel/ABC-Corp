## Welcome to ABC Corp's Website

This project is a continuation of our [database groups final project](https://github.com/shu-csas-changgar/final-project-db-final). This version aims to redesign the website into a more user friendly experience while taking the lessons we have learned from the original project to create a more thorough and powerful website.


## Project Goals:

### Front End:
- Add dynamic updates/create modals which allow the user to update/create any information related to their update. (Can create a new address when creating a new employee...)
- Add role based users
- Create a working reservations system
- Search feature on every view with auto-complete
- Further abstract tables using Higher Order Components
- Create smooth CSS transitions between views and modals

### Back End:
- Use GraphQL instead of REST as websites API
- Use Programmed Queries or an ORM for server querying
- Refactor and Abstract files so that futures additions can be done with ease  

## Create-React-App Instructions
Create React App is a pre-built boilerplate for React applications. It saves you from having to manually install everything. Additional instructions can also be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
1) Open CMD and type the following: npm install -g create-react-app
2) Create a folder on your computer to store your react programs in
3) To create a react application cd to the folder you just created and type the following in CMD: create-react-app <App Name>. EX: create-react-app test-app (NOTE: No spaces or caps allowed)
4) Once created cd into the app you just made and type npm start to launch the app. To close the app hold control + c
5) Open the app in your editor of choice to change it
5) Repeat steps 3-5 to create a new app.
